# Genomic Data Science 

## Specialization program offered by Johns Hopkins University (Coursera)

This Specialization covers the concepts and tools to understand, analyze, and interpret data from next generation sequencing experiments. It teaches the most common tools used in genomic data science including how to use the command line, along with a variety of software implementation tools like Python, R, and Bioconductor. 

## Key tools in this repository:

### edit_distance.py 
Functions that determine the edit distance between a sequence and a genome using a matrix

### overlap_SCS.py
Functions that determine the overlaps and Shortest Common String (SCS) to assemble a genome from a set of sequences

### dna_blast.py
Runs blast (NCBI) on dna sequence

### fasta_dictionary.py
Reads a 'fasta' or 'txt' file and creates a dictionary containing all the DNA or AA's sequences in the file
